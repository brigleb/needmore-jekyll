This is a prototype of our site redesign in [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). It can be seen at http://brigleb.github.io/needmore-jekyll/ while in development.

When launching it locally, use `jekyll serve --baseurl ''` since it is being hosted as a GitHub Pages [project page](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/).
