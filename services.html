  <h2>What We Do</h2>
  <h4>Needmore is a design studio in rainy Portland, Oregon. We focus on creating digital and physical experiences that tell authentic stories about our clients’ brands and products, stories about sipping your first cup of hot coffee on a cold morning, delighting in a fresh baked brownie, or journeying out to a distant farm to sip wine made from nearby vines.</h4>
