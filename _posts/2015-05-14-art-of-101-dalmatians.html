<p>As designers, compromise can be tough. And yet, when our medium is a technical one, out-of the-box thinking can often mean huge wins for our clients (in terms of time) and for our designs (with the serendipity that tinkering often brings).</p>
<p>In 1959, Disney’s Animation Division was in trouble.  Sleeping Beauty bombed at the box office, and Walt Disney was considering better opportunities for the company elsewhere. If Disney was going to keep producing animated features, something had to change. With the production of One Hundred and One Dalmatians, it did.</p>
<p>During the production of it Disney told animator Eric Larson: “I don’t think we can continue,  it’s too expensive”. Despite this, he still had deep feelings towards animation because he had built the company upon it. In order to save money, Ub Iwerks (Disney's original aniamtion partner) turned to Xerox technology. With Xerox, rough drawings could be turned into animation cells directly, skipping the time-consuming step of drawing each cell.</p>
