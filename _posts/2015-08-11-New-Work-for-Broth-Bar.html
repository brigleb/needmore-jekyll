<p>Our friends at Salt, Fire & Time have long been a sustainable solution to the growing need for healthy, locally sourced ingredients in Portland.</p>
<p>Their newest venture, Broth Bar, is a natural extension of this ethos. This is a carefully curated space for eating well and in good company that opened doors today.</p>
